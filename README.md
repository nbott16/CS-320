To ensure my cod eis funtional and sceure I can validate and sanitize input,aAdopt "shift left" security, integrate linters, SAST, and dependency scanners into my CI/CD pipelines, apply dependecy management techniques, and use secure data handliing.

To interpret user needs I will Conduct User Research, Develop User Personas, Map the User Journey, Observe in Context, and Look past requested features to understand the underlying problem the user is trying to solve.

When I approach software I am designing I foucs on the useers needs, Build, test, and refine software in cycles, incorporating user feedback early and often to avoid costly post-production changes, Proactively identify potential security threats during the design phase using frameworks like STRIDE, use modular architecture,and  design for maintainabillity.
